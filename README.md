A toy-language "tree-walking" interpreter in Go.

The main purpose of this repo is for learning about the intricacies of interpreters, lexing, parsing
, ASTs, and evaluation.

This is based on the book "Writing an Interpreter with Go".

### Setup

Make sure your `GOPATH` is set up properly, ex:

1. `export GOPATH=$HOME/projects/gocode`
2. `cd $GOPATH/src/interpreter`
3. `go build`
